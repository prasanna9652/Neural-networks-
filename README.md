# Neural-networks-
Neural Networks are machine learning models inspired by the human brain, made up of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). They learn patterns from data through weighted connections and activation functions. Widely used in deep learning, they power image recognition, NLP, speech processing, and AI applications.
